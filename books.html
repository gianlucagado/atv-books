                    <p>Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good
                        headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great
                        to just skip that?</p>

                        <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own
                            projects. We
                            were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with
                            any
                            headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                    <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                        headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!</p>

            <h2>Experiments We Performed</h2>
            <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                very positive results with these headlines as well. </p>
            <p>They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our
                collection of 200 headlines with everyone.</p>
